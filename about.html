        <h1>About the Developer</h1>

        <!-- Short Bio -->
        <p>Hi, I'm Tyler McQuade, the developer behind **TransitEase**. With a background in technology and a passion for travel and fitness, I was inspired to create an app that makes commuting more efficient and enjoyable. 
        Combining my knowledge of software development and my love for exploring new places, I developed **TransitEase** to solve a common problem I encountered while traveling: the lack of easily accessible, real-time transit information.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout my journey, I've explored various aspects of technology, from building websites to learning programming concepts. I'm motivated by innovation and convenience, and **TransitEase** is a reflection of my personal drive to make everyday tasks, like commuting, simpler for everyone.</p>
